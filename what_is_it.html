            Media Queries are a feature in CSS that allows you as the developer to apply styles to your website depending on the size of a user's screen. Things like resolution, screen size, etc are the main factors in how a user views your website. Media queries are an important part of web design that helps make websites able to adapt and give users the best viewing experience possible on any size device. If media queries didn't exist it would cause accessibility and user experience issues on different size devices.

            The purpose of media queries is to improve user experience. For example, a website can look great on a desktop screen but cluttered and unorganized on a mobile device. Media queries allow developers to adjust styles, such as font size, layout, or image scaling, to suit the screen size.
           Media queries also play a big role in modern web design and features such as flexbox and grid systems on CSS, and since most people use their smartphones for information it is important to use mobile-friendly layouts.

            Using a media query is quite simple. As a developer, you will use the @media CSS rule to design your website for mobile devices or screens smaller than a desktop. We can also change styling on different size screens such as color, font, etc. This flexibility has revolutionized web development for the better and helps users all around the world have a good viewing experience.
