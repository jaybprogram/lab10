            Media queries are super important for making websites that work well on different screen sizes and devices. Without them, websites might look messed up or be hard to use on small screens like phones. They let developers adjust things like layouts and font sizes based on the size of the screen, so everything stays easy to read and use. This makes media queries a key part of designing websites that look good and work for everyone.

            Media queries make websites easier to use by changing layouts and styles to match the type of device. For instance, on smaller screens like phones, fonts can be made bigger, and buttons can be easier to tap, while larger screens can show more information at once. This flexibility helps websites look great and work well no matter what device youâ€™re on. Because of this, people can use websites more easily and without frustration.

            Media queries also help websites work better and be easier to access. They can load smaller files on phones, which makes pages load faster and easier to use. Media queries can also adjust to what people like, like turning on dark mode or high-contrast mode. This helps make websites more welcoming and usable for everyone, no matter their needs.
